        <h2>UI Design</h2>
        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 May 2016</h3>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our UI design choices have been largely impacted by our target audience,
            those that are not necessarily technically apt when it comes to programming. Therefore, our design choices
            reflect this by keeping the system visually simple and by leveling out the learning curve by immediately
            emphasizing how the user can interact with the system. In order to do this we’ll be using a design spec
            called Material Design. <br/> <br/>

            Material Design is a set of design guidelines and paradigms created and maintained by Google and has been
            put into use into many mobile and web applications. It strives to create a simple minimalist design language
            while still intelligently emphasizing UI elements by having said elements behave as if they were actual
            materials in a virtual space. This however is not to confused with Skeuomorphism wherein UI elements look
            and behave like their real world counterparts; In Material Design UI elements do not necessarily have to
            have a real world counterparts, but must behave in a way that would be logical if they did exist in the real
            world. The main Material Design paradigms we are focusing on include emphasizing UI elements using the
            aforementioned ‘material’ metaphor, page responsiveness and accessibility. <br/> <br/>


            By following the material metaphor, we’ll be organizing the UI by x and y axis but also by z axis.
            UI elements will have heights relative to each other and will be able to draw over each other and cast
            shadows depending on their importance. For example, in our current interface, the page edit pane draws over
            the rest of the UI, because it is to be the main focus when it is displayed, and also casts a shadow on the
            UI elements ‘under’ it to emphasize that the other UI elements are not important at that point in time. <br/> <br/>

            We hope to make FantasyMaker complex, yet accessible and easy to use so that anyone will be able to create
            awesome games and stories. <br/> <br/>

        <h2>Design Methodology</h2>
        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 May 2016</h3>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The design methodology our team will be following will be that of an
            iterative design approach. Iterative design is a very effective methodology built upon the concept of
            ‘the best way to completely understand a design is to build it’. In practice, this concept takes the form
            of a loop of 3 processes: Designing, Prototyping and Analysis. <br/> <br/>

            In the design phase, system components or sub-systems are designed and preliminary artefacts (eg UML) are
            created in preparation for initial prototyping. Unlike Waterfall model, these artefacts are not rigorous,
            heavily detailed documents that are meant to model the final system. They are meant as a guide to build the
            component in the best possible way with the development team's current knowledge about the problem. A
            prototype of the component is then created. The most important aspect of the prototyping phase is the
            knowledge and experience the development team gains about the problem scope while producing the prototype.
            Finally, during the analysis phase, the development team then closely reviews and assesses that prototype.
            This is the most critical phase as any unexpected issues that occurred during the prototype development or
            with the design itself can be identified. The loop then repeats with this new knowledge gained. The
            following iterations on the development of this component are completed with the intention of correcting
            design issues and refining the prototype until an acceptable product is produced.</p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 May 2016</h3>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FantasyMaker is geared largely toward a broad target market characterised by a
            number of key features, mainly creators who are: <br/> </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Interested in fiction and stories</li>
            <li>Enjoy games driven primarily by their plot</li>
            <li>Interested in creating their own games and interactive media</li>
            <li>Low to no level of programming skill or interest</li>
            <li>More graphically minded than analytical</li>
            </ul>
            <br/> <br/>
        <p>The product itself is aimed primarily at the creators of such games, though the games they themselves
            create and the community surrounding FantasyMaker will be targeted at similar demographics, primarily </p><br/>
            <ul>
            <li>Young adults</li>
            <li>More female representation than the general “gaming” demographic</li>
            <li>Interest in books, novels, and plot focused games with interactive elements</li>
            </ul>
