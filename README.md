# FantasyMaker

FantasyMaker is a web application that allows creators to design "Choose your own Adventure" style video games and visual novels.

FantasyMaker was created by a team of three for our final year project in our B Computer Science Degrees, supervised by Luke McAven.

FantasyMaker is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and node.js, and utilises a number of libraries and frameworks including [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) and [interact.js](http://interactjs.io/). 

Main branch for source code is [viewable here](https://github.com/dpekkle/FantasyMaker/tree/gh-pages).
