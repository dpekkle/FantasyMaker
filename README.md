# FantasyMaker

FantasyMaker is a web application that allows creators to design "Choose your own Adventure" style video games and visual novels.

FantasyMaker was created by a team of three Computer Science students for our final year project, supervised by Luke McAven.

FantasyMaker is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and node.js, and utilises a number of libraries and frameworks including [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) and [interact.js](http://interactjs.io/).
